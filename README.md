# serial-manager

FOR STARTING A NEW SERIAL:

	1. OPEN serial.sh
	2. SET THE "location" TO THE DIRECTORY WHERE THE SEASON(S) ARE LOCATED, NOT WHERE THE EPISODES ARE, i.e. location SHOULD STRICTLY BE THE PARENT DIRECTORY OF THE EPISODES DIRECTORY
	3. You may check if the extention of your videos/songs are already in the 'allextentions' just below 'location'.
		If not, add your extention at the end with a space


THIS CAN ALSO WORK FOR PLAYING MUSIC
	JUST SET THE location AND extionsion APPROPRIATELY


-->TO RUN:
	OPEN TERMINAL AND TYPE "./serial <argument(s)>"
	TYPES OF ARGUMENTS:
		' ' : (NO ARGUMENT) OPENS LAST PLAYED EPISODE

		'+' : OPENS NEXT EPISODE.
		      BUT IF ALL EPISODES OF THE SEASON ARE OVER,
		      THEN TRIES TO OPEN NEXT SEASON'S 1ST EPISODE
		'-' : OPENS PREVIOUS EPISODE IF ALREADY NOT THE 1ST EPISODE OF THE SEASON
		'.' : JUMPS TO THE NEXT SEASON'S FIRST EPISODE

'<NUMBER1> <NUMBER2>' : OPENS SEASON NUMBER <NUMBER1> AND EPISODE NUMBER <NUMBER2>

REASON OF MAKING THIS: COULDN'T REMEMBER WHICH EPISODE TO WATCH NEXT
